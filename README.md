“Web Application” is a computer program that is accessed through a web browser and runs on a remote server rather than on a user's local device. It is designed to provide functionality and services to users over the internet. Web applications can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as e-commerce, social networking, online banking, online storage and file sharing, email, and more.

Web applications are typically built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and often use a server-side scripting language like PHP, Python, or Ruby to process data and generate dynamic content. They may also rely on databases to store and retrieve data, and APIs to integrate with other systems and services.

Examples of popular web applications include Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and Google Maps.
